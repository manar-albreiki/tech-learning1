Introduction to Stack Comparison

Stack comparison involves analyzing and evaluating different technology stacks used in web and software development. Each stack is a combination of frontend, backend, and database technologies that work together to build complete applications. Comparing stacks helps developers and organizations choose the most suitable set of tools based on factors like project requirements, scalability, performance, ease of development, and community support. Understanding the strengths and weaknesses of each stack ensures better decision-making for creating efficient, maintainable, and future-ready applications.

MERN is a full JavaScript stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) that allows developers to use a single language for both frontend and backend, making it flexible, fast for development, and ideal for dynamic web applications.

Spring Boot is a Java-based framework for building robust backend applications, often paired with Angular or React for the frontend and relational databases like MySQL or PostgreSQL, offering strong scalability, reliability, and enterprise-level support.
