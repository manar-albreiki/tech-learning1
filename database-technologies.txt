Database technologies are essential for storing, organizing, and managing data used by web applications. MySQL is a popular relational database that uses structured tables and SQL queries to handle data efficiently, making it suitable for applications that require strict data consistency. MongoDB is a NoSQL database that stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents, allowing easy handling of unstructured or rapidly changing data. PostgreSQL is an advanced relational database known for its reliability, scalability, and support for complex queries and data types. Together, these databases provide developers with tools to manage data effectively, ensuring performance, security, and scalability for web applications.
