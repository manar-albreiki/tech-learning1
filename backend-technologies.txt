Backend development uses technologies that handle the server-side logic, databases, and application functionality. Node.js is a JavaScript runtime that allows developers to build fast and scalable server-side applications, often used for real-time web apps. Python is a versatile language with frameworks like Django and Flask that simplify backend development and database management. PHP is widely used for creating dynamic websites and works well with databases like MySQL to handle content management and server-side scripting. These backend technologies work together to ensure websites and applications run smoothly, securely, and efficiently.
