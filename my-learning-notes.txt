Today’s learning about Git commands showed how version control helps manage and track changes in software development. Basic commands like `git init`, `git add`, and `git commit` are essential for creating a repository and saving progress. Commands such as `git push` and `git pull` enable collaboration by sending and retrieving updates between the local repository and a remote one like GitHub. Overall, Git commands make teamwork easier, prevent file loss, and maintain an organized history of every change made in a project.
