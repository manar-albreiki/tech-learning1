 Web Development

Introduction:
Web development is the process of creating websites and web applications that run on the internet. It involves designing, building, and maintaining websites using a combination of programming languages, frameworks, and tools. Web development covers both the front-end, which deals with the visual interface and user experience, and the back-end, which handles the server, database, and application logic. This field is essential for connecting users to digital services and delivering interactive, accessible, and functional online experiences.

Frontend development focuses on the part of a website or web application that users interact with directly. It involves designing and coding the layout, visuals, and interactive elements using technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Frontend developers ensure that websites are responsive, user-friendly, and visually appealing across different devices and browsers. Frameworks and libraries such as React, Angular, and Vue.js help streamline development and create dynamic, interactive interfaces. Overall, frontend development bridges the gap between design and functionality, making digital experiences engaging for users.
