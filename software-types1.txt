Software can be categorized into two main types: system software and application software. System software, like operating systems, helps control hardware and provides a platform for other programs to run. Application software includes programs designed for users, such as browsers, office tools, or mobile apps, to perform specific tasks.

web Applications 
Web applications are software programs that run through a web browser instead of being installed on a device. They are accessible from anywhere with an internet connection, which makes them flexible and convenient for users. Examples include online banking platforms, e-commerce websites, and email services like Gmail. Web applications are continuously updated by the provider, ensuring users always have the latest features without manual installation.
